confluence-psds
===============
This repository contains the PSDs of the Confluence skin. Because Confluence is based on Mediastream Redux, some of the used graphics are still form Mediastream, which is why it's artwork is for now also part of this repo. Unfortunately Mediastream Redux was only a mod, which means that it reused graphics from the original Mediastream skin for which we don't have any sources/PSDs.
